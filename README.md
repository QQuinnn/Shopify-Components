# Shopify-Components ðŸ“†
Community shared components suitable for putting in a Shopify store. Includes custom Sections, Templates, and Snippets.

## An introduction
This repository is a tool for fellow Shopify users to gather and share their own custom components. Getting help on the Shopify forums is sufficient, but with a number of users who already have their stores customised to their liking, this affords them the opportunity to share their special components. Share with your friends and other budding entrepreneurs to get the best out of your stores.

## Pre-requisites
Before you contribute to the repository please take note of the existing components as well as their structures. To avoid duplication of components contributors must include an image of the final product with how it looks in a live store. The full requirements are as follows:

  * All files involved in the manipulation that aren't standard to the theme are uploaded
  * Your commit follows the structure *theme*/*description-of-component*/
    * For component types place them in their own sub-folders. E.g. venture/product-collection/**templates/collection-no-price.liquid** and venture/product-collection/**snippets/product-card-no-price.liquid**.
  * Your commit includes an image of the final component in either a jpeg or png format
  * If there are any changes to large files such as theme.scss(.liquid), theme.js, or vendor.js please extract only those areas changed and detail them in a separate file.

## How to install and use the components
Simply pull all the files from the directory of your choosing and place them in the appropriate local directories. E.g. put all files from the resource you have pulled (product-collection/templates/\*) into your Shopify directory /templates/\*.

## How to contribute
Simply pull the repository, branch off it, commit to it, and make a pull request. Pull requests are only able to be approved from repository administrators.
